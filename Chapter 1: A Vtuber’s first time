"Chitose- time to wake up my little Songbird”

"Ughhh, give me another hour Rose. please”

"Chitose, it's nearly 2 pm, remember the charity steam we have today?”

"Oh yeah.....that is today isn't it?”

"Sigh, It is, I'm going to make you breakfast, you better be awake when it's done”

"Understood-”

My name is Chitose Songleaf, I am a high elf Vtuber living in the city of Hdolaon and live with my best friend......and my crush. us and one of our friends, a little fairy named August started a small fantasy-themed Vtubing group together. and for the last three years, our numbers slowly grew until we became a rising star in the Vtubing world, nowadays our streams easily get over 10k views and we have gotten lots of deals. Our fans love each of our different personalities: Rose playing up the seductive and playful nature of succubi, August’s carefree and caring ‘big sister’ energy, and my cheerful personality. although the last one isn’t entirely the truth-

“Ah, damn it, drop my toothbrush. sigh, always acting up at the most inconvenient times”

the truth is the personality I put up for my viewers is an act…..well most of it is, I do have an interest and like for music, animals, and boba, and the other interests I say I have on Steam. but I am not nearly as cheerful as I let on, in truth, I am a depressed introvert with chronic pain and EDS and need to drink energy drinks in order to keep focus and motivated. but no matter how sad I get my friends, and especially Rose is always there to cheer me up and give me a reason to keep going. (EDS stands for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)

Rose….my sweet and beautiful little succubus……

“Chitose! your breakfast is ready!”

“coming!”

ugh, nearly fell asleep daydreaming about Rose again. but how can I not? She has always been there for me; offering me a place to stay when I ran away from home, keeping me company when I was sad, always cooking my meals for me. not to mention her silky long blonde hair, soft light purple skin, her light blue eyes that shine like the sea at midday, and of course her large breasts that she lets me use as a pillow at night. and the highlight of my mornings, seeing her with her hair tied into a ponytail and wearing that green and dark blue checkerboard cooking dress I bought her.

“yawn….Good morning Bella, food smells good”

“Thanks, a steak with sliced carrots and apples”

“That sounds good” gods her soft smile melts my heart every time I see it, AHHHHH I love her so much. “So when is the charity steam again?”

“you already forgotten? it’s on Sunday”

“wh-what! isn’t today Friday!? why did you say it was today?”

“well I needed to get you out of bed somehow”

“hmph, I could still be asleep right now. dreaming of cute mice and sweetcakes”

“Hehehehe sorry my Songbird, but you have been sleeping the days away a lot lately. I’m starting to worry about you, you should be taking better care of yourself”

“I-I know, sigh, it’s just-” I always hate it when i make Rose worry, makes me feel like more of the burden then I already am. 

“I-I know, sigh, it’s just-” I always hate it when i make Rose worry, makes me feel like more of the burden then I already am. I wish I could just disappear and stop brotherin- ding! “Is that my phone?”

“Yup, what do you know? August wants to meet up with you at the Brewing Snake”

“August? why meet me in person on the other side of the city from where she lives? could’ve just texted me-” 

“Hehe, well you know August never liked talking to her friends via text”

“I guess…well it has been a minute since i went there huh? wonder how Rzyth is doing” 

"Bet they miss you Chit"

"Kinda miss them too.....alright i'm going to go, been a while 

“What? don’t like my coffee?”

“I-I’m saying that Bella!” why does my heart flatter every time she teases me? “Ok, I'm heading out Bella”

“Don’t forget your cane Chit!”

“Oh right-” Ever since I could remember I needed a cane, being bone with EDS met the bones in my legs broke down. so even as a child, I needed the support of a cane to go anyway outside my house. “See you later Rose”

“See ya”
